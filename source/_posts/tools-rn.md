#### Webpack

* Whatever the asset, just bundle it
* Loads of deps -- 1 build artifact
* Very extendible

#### Mocha + Sinon

* Pleasant and clean

#### React

* Just `render`!
* Don't sweat application transitions
* When you need to, it's obvious

#### Redux

* Haven't played with it yet but very eager to test when v1 drops

#### Babel/ES6

* I was just feeling prepared to accept that JS is a playtoy w/ too strong a community

#### Task runners and test runners

* Why are we writing procedural synchronous tasks in JS?
* `make` still seems best, but `bash` is too nuts
* Test runners are too opinionated, not extendible enough...
* `karma` seems best, but extendibility feels constrained

#### Takeaways

* Make it dead simple to reason about
* Let the machine do the work, but understand when and where you're doing so
